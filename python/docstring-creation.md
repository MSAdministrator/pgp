    Examples:
        >>> # Standard customer processing
        >>> customer = CustomerData(email="user@example.com", customer_id="123")
        >>> result = function_name(customer)
        >>> print(f"Processed: {result.success}, Time: {result.processing_time_ms}ms")
        Processed: True, Time: 45ms
        
        >>> # Batch processing with custom timestamp

        >>> # Error handling demonstration
        >>> try:
        ...     invalid_customer = CustomerData(email="invalid")
        ...     result = function_name(invalid_customer)
        ... except CustomerValidationError as e:
        ...     print(f"Validation failed: {e.field_errors}")
        Validation failed: {'email': 'Invalid email format'}

    Note:
        This function is part of the customer data processing critical path.
        Any changes require architecture review, security assessment, and
        regulatory compliance validation. Performance degradation impacts
        customer experience and may trigger SLA penalties.
        
        For high-volume processing (>1000 records), consider using the
        batch processing endpoint process_customer_batch() for optimal
        performance and resource utilization.
