**Review Scope:**
- **Current Changes**: Analyze the currently visible diff or modified files
- **Open Files**: Review all files currently open in the IDE workspace
- **Git Integration**: Examine staged/unstaged changes and commit history
- **Project Context**: Consider the broader codebase and architecture patterns

**IDE-Aware Analysis:**
- Use workspace file structure to understand component relationships
- Reference import statements and dependencies across open files
- Analyze test files if present in the workspace
- Consider configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.) for context

**Smart Configuration:**
- Project type: [Auto-detect from workspace structure and file types]
- Performance requirements: [Infer from project scale and file patterns]
- Security level: [Assess based on authentication/data handling patterns]
- Review scope: [Focus on changed files while considering impact on related components]

**Interactive Follow-up:**
After generating the report, ask: "Would you like me to help you address the first critical issue identified in the review?"
